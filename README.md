# Disease Symptoms and Treatments Analysis â€“ Power BI Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **disease symptoms and treatments** using a structured dataset. The aim was to identify key health trends, such as common symptoms, chronic and contagious disease distribution, and overlapping conditions. A **Power BI dashboard** was built to present insights clearly and interactively.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Identify the most common symptoms across diseases.
* Analyze the distribution of chronic diseases.
* Analyze the distribution of contagious diseases.
* Determine diseases that are both chronic and contagious.
* Provide a summary of total diseases covered in the dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Details

* **File Name:** Diseases_Symptoms.xlsx
* **Size:** ~405 records
* **Columns Used:**

  * **Name** â€“ Disease name
  * **Symptoms** â€“ Associated symptoms
  * **Treatment** â€“ Suggested treatment
  * **Disease_Code** â€“ Unique identifier
  * **Contagious** â€“ Boolean (True/False)
  * **Chronic** â€“ Boolean (True/False)

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques

* **Power BI** for visualization
* **DAX Measures** to calculate combined conditions (chronic + contagious)
* **Excel** for initial dataset preparation

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Highlights

* **Top 5 most common symptoms** (Fatigue, Headache, Abdominal Pain, etc.)
* **Chronic disease distribution** (72.6% chronic)
* **Contagious disease distribution** (27.9% contagious)
* **Overlap analysis**: Diseases that are both chronic and contagious
* **Total disease count:** 405

## ðŸš€ Key Learnings

* Gained hands-on experience in **data cleaning, DAX, and Power BI dashboard design**.
* Learned how to extract insights from a limited dataset with categorical and boolean values.
* Practiced transforming raw healthcare data into **actionable insights**.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Scope

* Enhance dataset with patient demographics for deeper insights.
* Add time-series data (disease progression, seasonal outbreaks).
* Integrate external healthcare datasets for more comprehensive analysis.
